In the fast-paced world of **Monopoly GO**, protecting your assets from opponents' attacks is crucial. Shields serve as your primary defense, absorbing attacks and preventing damage to your valuable properties. Additionally, the introduction of shield skins adds a layer of personalization, allowing players to flaunt their achievements with style. This guide will explore everything you need to know about shields and shield skins in Monopoly GO, including how to acquire, manage, and utilize them effectively.

## What Are Shields in Monopoly GO?

Shields in Monopoly GO act as a protective barrier for your properties. When an opponent attempts a "Shutdown" attack, an active shield will absorb the blow, keeping your buildings safe. Having multiple shields can provide ongoing protection, making it harder for opponents to set you back. Shields are vital for maintaining your in-game progress and reducing losses.

## How to Acquire Shields

Shields can be collected by various methods within the game:

1. **Board Navigation**: While playing, you may land on tiles marked with shield icons. Doing so automatically adds a shield to your inventory, ready to defend your properties from incoming attacks.
   
2. **Daily Rewards and Events**: Participating in daily challenges and special events often rewards players with shields. These events are frequently updated, offering new opportunities to earn additional shields.
   
3. **Quick Wins and Achievements**: Completing specific in-game tasks or achieving milestones may also reward you with shields. Keep an eye on objectives in the Wins section to maximize shield collection.

## Managing and Using Shields

Proper shield management is key to staying ahead in Monopoly GO. Here are some strategies:

- **Prioritize High-Value Properties**: Use your shields to protect properties that generate the most income or are most likely to be targeted by opponents.
  
- **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on notifications signaling attacks. Deploy shields strategically based on where attacks are expected.
  
- **Balance Your Shield Inventory**: Don’t waste shields on low-risk situations. Instead, save them for critical moments when your key properties are under threat.

## What Are Shield Skins?

Shield skins are cosmetic items that allow players to customize the appearance of their shields. Introduced as part of a game update, these skins provide a unique aesthetic touch to your defenses, showcasing your accomplishments and style. Shield skins can be collected and displayed in your Shield Showroom, accessible from the game menu.

## How to Get Shield Skins

Obtaining shield skins usually requires participation in special events and tournaments:

1. **Event Participation**: Many shield skins are available as rewards during limited-time events. Players must complete specific challenges or rank high in these events to unlock skins.
   
2. **Tournament Success**: Achieving top placements in tournaments is another way to earn exclusive shield skins. The rarity of these skins often correlates with the difficulty of the event, making them a coveted prize for competitive players.

3. **Daily and Weekly Rewards**: Regularly logging in and participating in daily tasks can sometimes provide opportunities to collect shield skins.

### How to Change Shield Skins

Customizing your shield skins is straightforward:

1. Access the menu from the top of the screen.
2. Select the 'Shields' option to open your inventory.
3. Choose your desired skin from the collection and equip it.

This feature allows you to switch up your shield’s appearance as often as you like, keeping your game experience fresh and personalized.

## Conclusion

Shields and shield skins in Monopoly GO are more than just protective measures—they are strategic tools and status symbols. By effectively collecting and using shields, you can safeguard your empire from attacks and maintain a competitive edge.
