POP! Slots, part of the PLAYSTUDIOS gaming portfolio, offers an exciting feature known as the **myVIP Loyalty Program**. This program is designed to reward dedicated players with exclusive benefits and perks, making the game more engaging and rewarding. This article breaks down everything you need to know about the myVIP Tiers, including how to earn points, what benefits are available, and strategies to advance through the tiers effectively.

## What is the myVIP Loyalty Program?

The myVIP Loyalty Program in POP! Slots is a tiered system where players accumulate Tier Points to unlock progressively higher levels of rewards. Each tier comes with increased benefits, ranging from in-game perks like extra chips to real-world rewards such as hotel stays and show tickets in Las Vegas.

**How It Works:**
- **Earning Tier Points:** Players earn Tier Points by engaging in various activities within the game, such as collecting daily and hourly bonuses, purchasing chip bundles, and playing across multiple PLAYSTUDIOS games that are connected through the myVIP system.
- **Advancing Through Tiers:** The more Tier Points you earn, the higher you climb through the VIP levels. POP! Slots features up to 10 tiers, with each subsequent tier offering better rewards and more exclusive benefits.

## Overview of the myVIP Tiers

The myVIP Tiers start from Tier 1 and go up to Tier 10, each offering a unique set of benefits:

1. **Tier 1-3:** These initial levels offer basic perks like extra chips from daily bonuses and hourly bonuses.
2. **Tier 4-6:** Mid-level tiers provide even more chips and may include some real-world perks, such as discounts on hotel bookings or show tickets.
3. **Tier 7-9:** At these advanced tiers, players enjoy significant in-game benefits, including priority customer support, larger bonus chips, and more valuable rewards.
4. **Tier 10:** The pinnacle of the myVIP program, Tier 10, grants players the best perks, including the highest amount of bonus chips, exclusive real-world rewards, and top-tier customer service.

## How to Maximize Your myVIP Status

To make the most out of the myVIP program, consider these strategies:

1. **Consistency is Key:** Regularly collect your daily and hourly bonuses to accumulate Tier Points steadily.
2. **Strategic Purchases:** Buying chip bundles during promotions can give you a significant boost in Tier Points, helping you climb the tiers faster.
3. **Play Across Platforms:** Since the myVIP program is interconnected across the PLAYSTUDIOS portfolio, playing on other affiliated games like myVEGAS can help you earn more points.
