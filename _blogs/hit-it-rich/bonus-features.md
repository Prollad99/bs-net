Here's what you need to know about the key bonus features in **Hit It Rich! Slots**.

## 1. Rich Pass

One of the standout features in Hit It Rich is the **Rich Pass**, a rewards system that unlocks new challenges daily. As you complete these challenges, you earn Rich Pass points, which can be redeemed for unique rewards.

However, if you want to fast-track your progress, coin packages are available for purchase.

## 3. Elite Status and VIP Perks

As you play, you'll earn experience points (XP) that help you level up. Higher levels unlock additional games and offer more lucrative rewards.
