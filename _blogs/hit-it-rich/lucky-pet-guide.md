Hit It Rich! is a popular social casino game that combines the excitement of slot machines with engaging features and bonuses. One such feature is the **Lucky Pet**, which can significantly enhance your gameplay experience. This guide will delve into everything you need to know about the Lucky Pet, including how to level it up, the perks it offers, and strategies to make the most of it.

## What is the Lucky Pet?

The Lucky Pet is a virtual companion in Hit It Rich! that provides various perks to boost your gaming experience. As you interact with your pet, you can earn treats that activate these perks, which include improving your spin outcomes, enhancing your hourly bonuses, and boosting your scores in weekly events.

## How to Activate and Feed Your Lucky Pet

To start benefiting from the Lucky Pet, you need to feed it with Pet Treats. These treats are essential for leveling up your pet, which in turn improves the perks it can provide. You can earn Pet Treats through regular gameplay, completing specific in-game tasks, or by purchasing them directly.

## Perks of the Lucky Pet

Your Lucky Pet offers several valuable perks that can make your time in Hit It Rich! more rewarding:

1. **Rollover Respin**: One of the most exciting perks is the chance for a rollover respin. If you encounter a losing spin, your pet may give you a second chance, turning it into a guaranteed win. The likelihood of triggering this perk increases as you level up your pet.

2. **Hourly Bonus Multiplier**: Feeding your pet and leveling it up also enhances your hourly bonus wheel multiplier, meaning you'll earn more coins each hour just by having a well-fed, high-level pet.

3. **Weekly Race Boost**: For competitive players, leveling up the pet to its maximum "Hyper" state can provide a 25% boost to your scores in weekly races, giving you a significant edge over other players.

## Strategies to Maximize Your Lucky Pet

- **Consistent Feeding**: Make sure to consistently feed your pet with Pet Treats to keep its status high. A higher-status pet is more likely to activate its perks, which can be crucial during gameplay.
  
- **Focus on Leveling Up**: Prioritize leveling up your pet to unlock the full range of perks. As your pet reaches higher levels, the benefits will increase, providing more significant boosts to your coin earnings and spin results.

- **Participate in Events**: Engage in events that offer Pet Treats as rewards. This will allow you to maintain a steady supply of treats to feed your pet, ensuring that it remains active and helpful.

## Conclusion

The Lucky Pet feature in Hit It Rich! is more than just a fun addition; it's a strategic tool that can significantly enhance your gaming experience. By focusing on leveling up your pet and taking full advantage of the perks it provides, you can maximize your success in the game.
