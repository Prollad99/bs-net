The "Hit It Rich Cruise Crew" is a team-based event in the popular social casino game *Hit It Rich! Slots* by Zynga. This event allows players to join forces in completing various objectives to earn in-game rewards. Whether you're new to the game or a seasoned player, understanding how Cruise Crew works can enhance your gaming experience and maximize your rewards.

## What is Hit It Rich Cruise Crew?

Cruise Crew is a collaborative competition where players are randomly assigned to a crew. The main objective is to work together to complete "Tours," which are essentially challenges requiring the collection of specific items, known as mementos. Each successful Tour completed brings your crew closer to earning rewards.

## How to Participate

Participating in a Cruise Crew event is simple. When the event is active, you will automatically be assigned to a crew. Your job is to spin the slot machines, which are the core of *Hit It Rich*, to collect mementos needed to progress through the Tours. The more you spin, the more mementos you collect, contributing to your crew's progress.

## Collecting Mementos

Mementos are collected by spinning on any slot machine available in the game. Different slot machines may have varying odds of awarding mementos, so it's a good idea to try out different ones to see which works best for you. Keep an eye on the number of mementos required for each Tour and strategize your spins accordingly.

## Reward Distribution

Rewards in the Cruise Crew event are distributed based on the collective effort of the crew members. Once a Tour is completed, each member of the crew will receive a share of the prize pool. The amount you receive depends on your contribution to the crew's success, encouraging players to be active and engaged throughout the event.

## Boosting Your Crew

To give your crew an edge, consider purchasing Crew Packs. These special deals not only boost your chances of earning more coins but also allow you to send bonus gifts to your crewmates, fostering a sense of teamwork and cooperation. Crew Packs can be a valuable investment if you're serious about maximizing your rewards in the Cruise Crew event.

## Common Issues and Tips

- **Gift Collection Limits**: Be mindful of the daily limits on collecting gifts from crewmates. Once you reach your daily limit, you won't be able to collect more until the next day.
- **Continuous Tours**: Tours continue infinitely until the event ends. Completing one Tour starts a new one, so there's always a chance to earn more rewards.
- **Strategic Play**: Focus on spinning slot machines that offer higher memento drops to expedite your crew’s progress.

## Conclusion

The Hit It Rich Cruise Crew event is a fun and engaging way to collaborate with other players while spinning your favorite slots. By understanding the mechanics, actively participating, and strategizing your spins, you can maximize your rewards and enjoy the game to its fullest. So, gather your crew, start spinning, and embark on your next virtual cruise adventure!
