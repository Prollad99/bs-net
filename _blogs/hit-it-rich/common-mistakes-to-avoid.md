*Hit It Rich Slots* by Zynga offers a thrilling gaming experience, but like any other slot game, it comes with its pitfalls. To help you get the most out of your gaming sessions, here are five common mistakes to avoid:

## 1. **Betting Too Much Too Soon**
It’s easy to get carried away, especially when you start winning early on. However, betting large amounts too quickly can drain your balance before you have the chance to experience the game fully. Instead, start with smaller bets and gradually increase them as you get a better feel for the game. This strategy not only extends your playtime but also gives you more opportunities to hit those elusive big wins.

## 2. **Ignoring the Paylines and Game Rules**
Every slot game has its own set of rules, and *Hit It Rich* is no different. Many players jump in without fully understanding how the paylines work or what triggers the bonus rounds. This lack of knowledge can lead to missed opportunities and lower payouts. Always take a few minutes to read the game’s instructions, especially the paytable, to ensure you’re maximizing your chances of winning.

## 3. **Chasing Losses**
One of the biggest mistakes in slot gaming is chasing losses. If you’ve hit a rough patch, it’s important to remember that slots are designed with a house edge, meaning the odds are always in favor of the casino in the long run. Chasing losses can lead to even bigger losses. Set a budget for your session and stick to it, regardless of how the game is going.

## 4. **Not Taking Advantage of Bonuses and Free Coins**
*Hit It Rich* offers various bonuses and free coin opportunities that many players overlook. Regularly collecting free coins through daily bonuses or other promotions can significantly extend your playtime. Don’t forget to visit sites like [BonusCollector.net](https://bonuscollector.net/hit-it-rich-free-coins/) to claim your free coins and bonuses to keep your bankroll healthy.

## 5. **Overplaying Without Breaks**
It’s easy to lose track of time when you’re immersed in the game, especially with its engaging features and colorful graphics. However, overplaying can lead to fatigue, poor decision-making, and unnecessary losses. Set a timer or take regular breaks to keep your mind fresh and ensure you’re playing responsibly.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you can enhance your enjoyment of *Hit It Rich Slots* and improve your chances of walking away with a win. Remember to play smart, stay within your limits, and most importantly, have fun!
