Jenny’s Store is a popular side game in Jackpot World, known for its engaging mechanics and rewarding outcomes. This game is centered around merging items to create higher-level objects, ultimately helping players progress through levels and win big prizes. Whether you’re new to the game or looking to optimize your strategy, this guide will help you make the most out of Jenny’s Store.

## Understanding the Basics

In Jenny’s Store, your primary goal is to merge items to fulfill orders and progress through the levels. You start by ordering items from the Factory, which can be accessed by clicking the Factory icon at the bottom right of the game screen. Once you have the items, you can merge two identical low-level items to create a higher-level one. This merging process is key to completing orders and advancing in the game.

## How to Earn Coins and Merge Items

Coins are crucial in Jenny’s Store, as they allow you to purchase items needed for merging. The more coins you have, the faster you can progress. You can earn coins by placing bets in the slot machine. The higher your bet, the quicker your coin collection grows. After ordering the necessary items, check the "Check List" to see what you need to merge.

A unique feature in Jenny’s Store is the ability to merge coins themselves. Initially, you may receive coins wrapped in plastic, which can be unwrapped using jewels. If left unwrapped, these coins will turn into mergeable items over time. Merging lower-level coins into higher-level ones can significantly increase your earnings, making this a highly rewarding aspect of the game.

## Tips for Success

1. **Plan Your Merges**: Always keep an eye on the items within the blue frame—these are the key to passing levels. Focus on merging these items to complete orders efficiently.
  
2. **Maximize Coin Merges**: Merging coins from level 1 to level 3 can yield substantial rewards. For instance, while level 1 coins might be worth 1.48B, merging them up to level 3 could bring their value up to 29.7B, significantly boosting your coin collection.

3. **Strategic Use of Jewels**: Consider whether to unwrap items using jewels or wait for them to convert into coins naturally. This decision can impact your overall strategy and success in the game.

## Conclusion

Jenny’s Store is not just a side game—it’s a strategic opportunity to enhance your Jackpot World experience. By focusing on effective merging techniques and maximizing your coin collections, you can progress through levels faster and reap greater rewards. Keep these tips in mind, and you’ll be well on your way to mastering Jenny’s Store.
