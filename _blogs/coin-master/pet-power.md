Pets in Coin Master aren't just cute companions; they are vital assets that can significantly enhance your gameplay. By leveraging your pets' unique abilities, you can maximize your coin earnings, protect your village, and gain an edge over other players. In this guide, we'll dive into each pet's strengths, how to best use them, and tips on keeping them at peak performance.

## Understanding the Coin Master Pets

Coin Master features three primary pets, each with its unique abilities that cater to different aspects of gameplay:

### 1. **Foxy – The Raid Specialist**
Foxy is the first pet you unlock upon reaching Village 4. This furry friend is essential during raids, as it helps you dig up extra coins from one marked spot, ensuring you get the maximum loot. Upgrading Foxy increases the number of coins you earn during raids, making it a must-have for players focused on rapidly expanding their villages.

### 2. **Tiger – The Attack Booster**
Tiger is unlocked by completing the "Beasts" card set and is your go-to pet for increasing coin rewards during attacks. When you land on three hammers, Tiger provides a substantial coin bonus, which can reach up to 417% more coins at higher levels. This pet is especially powerful during events like Attack Madness, where the extra coins can significantly accelerate your progress.

### 3. **Rhino – The Defender**
Rhino acts as your village's shield when you lack other defenses. Once unlocked, Rhino offers a chance to block incoming attacks, making it invaluable during times when your shield inventory is empty. As you upgrade Rhino, the chances of successfully deflecting attacks increase, offering greater protection for your hard-earned progress.

## How to Boost Your Pet Power

To make the most of your pets, you need to focus on three main activities: **feeding, upgrading,** and **strategic usage**.

### Feeding Your Pets
Feeding your pets keeps them active and ready to assist you during critical gameplay moments. Pet food can be earned through spinning the slot machine, completing in-game events, or daily rewards. You can also purchase pet food from the in-game shop. Always ensure your pet is well-fed before engaging in significant raids or attacks to avoid missing out on their bonuses.

### Upgrading Your Pets
Upgrading is crucial for maximizing your pets' abilities. Each pet has a different upgrade path, which increases their effectiveness:
- **Foxy:** Upgrades increase the amount of loot dug up during raids.
- **Tiger:** Higher levels offer more substantial coin bonuses during attacks.
- **Rhino:** Upgrades boost the probability of deflecting enemy attacks.

Consistent upgrading ensures your pets contribute effectively to your overall gameplay strategy.

### Strategic Usage
Choosing the right pet for the right scenario is key:
- **Use Foxy** when your priority is collecting as many coins as possible during raids.
- **Deploy Tiger** when participating in events that require frequent attacks or when you're aiming to gather massive amounts of coins quickly.
- **Switch to Rhino** when you’re under constant attack and need extra village protection.

By aligning your pet selection with your immediate goals, you can optimize your gameplay and ensure you stay ahead of the competition.

## Conclusion

Pets in Coin Master offer more than just companionship; they are strategic tools that can significantly enhance your gameplay. By understanding and utilizing Foxy, Tiger, and Rhino to their fullest potential, you'll be well-equipped to amass wealth, protect your village, and dominate the game. Remember to feed, upgrade, and strategically deploy your pets to harness their full power and elevate your Coin Master experience.
