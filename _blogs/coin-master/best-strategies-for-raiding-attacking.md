In the world of Coin Master, raiding and attacking other players' villages is essential to amass wealth and climb the ranks. However, to get the most out of these actions, you need more than just luck—you need strategy. Here’s how you can master the art of raiding and attacking to maximize your rewards and minimize your risks.

## 1. Perfect Timing for Maximum Rewards

Timing is everything in Coin Master, especially when it comes to raiding. When you land on the Raid symbol, take your time before selecting a target. It's often beneficial to wait a few seconds to allow your target to potentially gain more coins or lose their shields, making your raid more profitable. Keep an eye on your friends’ activity or social media announcements, as many players share their in-game achievements, indicating when they have a large stash of coins ripe for raiding.

*Tip:* Try to raid when your target is likely offline or after they’ve had a significant win. This can increase your chances of finding a target with more coins and fewer defenses.

## 2. Use Pets to Your Advantage

Pets play a crucial role in enhancing your raids. Foxy, in particular, is invaluable during Raid Madness events. Foxy increases the number of coins you earn from raids, which can significantly boost your total haul, especially when combined with high bets. Always make sure to feed and activate Foxy before you start spinning, especially during events like Raid Madness where every raid counts.

## 3. The Raid Madness Strategy

During the Raid Madness event, your goal is to complete missions and maximize the number of raids you perform. A popular strategy is to start spinning with a low bet and gradually increase it after a few successful raids. This pattern-based approach helps conserve spins while ensuring that you are always ready to capitalize on a raid opportunity. 

Additionally, if you’re aiming to complete the event, consider stopping once the mission requirements exceed half of your remaining spins. This ensures you don’t run out of spins before finishing the event.

## 4. Revenge Raids for Big Wins

Revenge raids can be incredibly satisfying and lucrative. If someone has raided your village, take note of who it was and keep an eye on their progress. When the time is right, strike back when they least expect it. This method not only allows you to reclaim some of your lost coins but can also yield a substantial profit if your timing is impeccable.

## 5. Protecting Your Village

While raiding is a key part of the game, protecting your village from being raided is equally important. Ensure you have a shield active at all times, especially after completing a big upgrade or accumulating a lot of coins. If possible, avoid logging out of the game immediately after a significant win, as this is when you are most vulnerable to attacks and raids. Instead, spend your coins on upgrades or chests to minimize your losses.

## 6. Stack Spins for Better Chances

Stacking spins is a technique where you accumulate as many spins as possible before a big event or raid session. This method gives you a higher chance of hitting multiple raids in succession, especially if you follow a spinning pattern. By having a large number of spins at your disposal, you increase the likelihood of triggering more raids, thus maximizing your coin earnings.

## Conclusion

Raiding and attacking in Coin Master require a blend of strategy, patience, and timing. By utilizing pets, timing your raids carefully, and protecting your village, you can significantly increase your in-game wealth. Whether you’re seeking revenge or aiming to top the leaderboards, these strategies will help you become a master raider in no time.
