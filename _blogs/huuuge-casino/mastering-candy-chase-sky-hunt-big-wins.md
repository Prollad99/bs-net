Huuuge Casino offers a plethora of engaging features, but none are as rewarding and thrilling as Candy Chase and Sky Hunt. These mini-games add an extra layer of excitement, providing players with the chance to earn additional rewards, including chips, diamonds, and exclusive items. To make the most of these features, it's crucial to understand how they work and the best strategies to win big.

## Understanding Candy Chase and Sky Hunt

Both Candy Chase and Sky Hunt are progress-based games integrated within Huuuge Casino's slot games. The core idea is simple: as you spin the slots, you accumulate moves that allow you to advance along a trail in either Candy Chase or Sky Hunt. Each move takes you one step closer to valuable rewards, and completing the trail rewards you with a chest filled with prizes.

### How to Play

1. **Earning Moves**: Moves are earned by spinning the slots. The more you spin, the more moves you accumulate. Every time you fill up the moves bar, you get one move to use in Candy Chase or Sky Hunt.

2. **Advancing on the Trail**: Use your moves strategically to advance along the trail. Each step on the trail offers different rewards, from chips and diamonds to XP boosts and lottery tickets.

3. **Collecting Rewards**: As you progress, you'll collect the reward at the step you land on. However, if you have excess moves, they will not roll over, so it's essential to use them before completing the trail.

4. **Completing the Trail**: Finishing the trail rewards you with a chest that contains multiple prizes. This is where the big wins come in, making it worthwhile to aim for completing the trail whenever possible.

### Tips for Maximizing Rewards

- **Frequent Play**: The more you spin, the more moves you earn. Frequent play is key to progressing quickly along the trail and maximizing your rewards.
- **Strategic Use of Moves**: Don't rush to use your moves as soon as you get them. Plan your moves to land on the steps that offer the best rewards.
- **Time Management**: Candy Chase and Sky Hunt are time-limited events. Keep an eye on the timer and make sure to use all your moves before the event ends to avoid losing out on potential rewards.
- **Combine with Free Chips**: Enhance your gameplay by collecting free chips regularly. This will allow you to spin more often and, in turn, earn more moves. You can collect free chips from [Huuuge Casino Free Chips](https://bonuscollector.net/huuuge-casino-free-chips/).

### Conclusion

Mastering Candy Chase and Sky Hunt requires a blend of strategic thinking and consistent gameplay. By understanding the mechanics and applying the tips mentioned, you can significantly increase your chances of winning big in Huuuge Casino. So, get ready to spin those slots and chase those rewards!
